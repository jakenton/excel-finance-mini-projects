# Mini Project 3 &mdash; Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis (Excel)

## Overview
This mini project demonstrates **scenario and sensitivity analysis** using Excel's two-variable Data Table feature. The workbook evaluates how changes in two independent drivers affect a single outcome metric.

The focus is on **understanding sensitivity and risk**, not prediction.

All data is simulated.

## Analytial Question
How sensitive is an outcome metric to changes in key drivers, both individually and in combination?

---

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Scenario analysis using Excel What-If tools
- Driver-based analytical thinking
- Evaluation of compounding effects
- Awareness of Excel calculation behavior

---

## Workbook Structure
- **Inputs**: Baseline value used as the anchor for scenario evaluation.
- **Model**: Single-output calculation applying independent drivers multiplicity.
- **Sensitivity_Table**: Two-variable Excel Data Table showing how the outcome metric changes across combinations of the two drivers.

---

## How to Use the Sensitivity Table
- The table evaluates outcomes across predefined driver ranges
- Excel Data Tables recalculate via explicit user action
    *(Data &#8594; What-If Analysis &#8594; Data Table &#8594; OK)*
This behavior reflects how Excel Data Tables are designed.

## Key Data Analyst Skills Used
- Scenario analysis
- Sensitivity analysis
- Driver-based modeling
- Interpreting multidimensional result grids

---

## Notes
- Data Tables are evaluation tools, not live formulas
- The table represents an analytial snapshot
- All data is simulated

---

## How This Would Be Used
This type of analysis supports decision-making by framing **ranges of outcomes** and identifying which drivers have the greatest impact.
