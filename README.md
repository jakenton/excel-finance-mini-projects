# Excel Analytics Mini Projects

## Overview
This repository contains three **Excel-based mini projects** designed to demonstrate core **data analysis skills** commonly required in Data Analyst roles. Each project focuses on a different analytical pattern&mdash;performance comparison, time-aware metrics, and scenario analysis&mdash;using clean data structures, transparent logic, and clear documentation.

All data used in these projects is **full simulated**.

## What These Projects Demonstrate
Across the three mini projects, this repository highlights:
- Structuring raw data into analysis-ready formats
- Aggregating and summarizing data using PivotTables
- Applying conditional logic to handle time-aware metrics
- Evaluating sensitivity and risk using scenario analysis
- Designing clear, interpretable analytical outputs in Excel
The emphasis is on **analytical reasoning and explainability**, not automation or domain-specific system ownership.

## Projects Included
### :one: Budget vs Actual Analysis
This project demonstrates how to compare observed values against a reference baseline across categories and time. Using PivotTables and summary KPIs, it highlights where meaningful deviations occur and supports exploratory investigation.

**Key concepts**:
- Baseline vs observed comparisons
- Aggregation across dimensions
- KPI calculation and variance interpretation

### :two: Rolling Metrics & Conditional Logic
**Focus**: Time-aware metrics that evolve as new data becomes available

This project demonstrates conditional logic in Excel to dynamically switch between observed values for completed periods and estimated values for future periods. The goal is to show correct analytical behavior over time, not predictive modeling.

**Key concepts**:
- IF-based conditional logic
- Handling completed vs future periods
- Input-driven recalculation

### :three: Sensitivity & Scenario Analysis
**Focus**: Understanding how outcomes respond to changes in key drivers

This project uses Excel's two-variable Data Table feature to evaluate how an outcome metric changes across combinations of two independent drivers. It emphasizes sensitivity analysis and interpretation rather than forecasting.

**Key concepts**:
- Scenario evaluation
- Driver-based thinking
- Interpreting multidimensional result grids

## Intended Audience
These projects are intended for:
- Hiring managers evaluating Excel and analytical skills
- Recruiters seeking evidence of hands-on data analysis
- Data analysts interested in transferable Excel patterns
While some examples use financial-style data, the analytical approaches apply broadly to **operations, program evaluation, product analytics, and reporting contexts**.

## Notes
- All data is simulated
- Projects prioritize transparency and documentation
- Excel is used deliberately to demonstrate fundamentals that transfer for SQL, BI tools, and scripting workflows.

## Summary
Together, these three projects demonstrate how Excel can be used effectively for:
- Comparing expected vs observed outcomes
- Maintaining time-aware metrics
- Evaluating sensitivity and risk
The are designed to show **how an analyst thinks**, now just what tools they use.
